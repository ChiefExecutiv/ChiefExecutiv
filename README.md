## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Benjamin**, interested in Machine Learning, Web development, generally a lot of things.

Currently, I'm a student of Economics at Makerere University Business School and do some programming on the side.

I love to learn and I'm always curious about new and emerging technology. I constantly seek new knowledge and made that my hobby, more or less.

Feel free to go through my modest work.
